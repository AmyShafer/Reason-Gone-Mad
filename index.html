            The Marx Brothers were an American family comedy act that was
            successful in vaudeville, on Broadway, and in motion pictures from
            1905 to 1949. (Source:

            Five of the Marx Brothers' thirteen feature films were selected by
            the American Film Institute (AFI) as among the top 100 comedy films,
            with two of them, Duck Soup (1933) and A Night at the Opera (1935),
            in the top fifteen. (Source:

            By the 1920s, the Marx Brothers had become one of America's favorite
            theatrical acts, with their sharp and bizarre sense of humor. They
            satirized high society and human hypocrisy, and they became famous
            for their improvisational comedy in free-form scenarios. A famous
            early instance was when Harpo arranged to chase a fleeing chorus
            girl across the stage during the middle of a Groucho monologue to
            see if Groucho would be thrown off. However, to the audience's
            delight, Groucho merely reacted by commenting, "First time I ever
            saw a taxi hail a passenger". (Source:

            On January 16, 1977, the Marx Brothers were inducted into the Motion
            Picture Hall of Fame.

            Among famous comedians who have cited them as influences on their
            style have been Mel Brooks, Carl Reiner, Monty Python, and Judd
            Apatow. (Source:
